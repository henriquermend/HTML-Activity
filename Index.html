            Imperial Esports, <strong>(formerly stylized as Imperial e-Sports)</strong> is a Brazilian professional e-sports organization.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            It is best known for its Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team, which is made up
            of a cast dubbed by fans of "The Last Dance",initially featuring veteran players
            from the Brazilian scene, such as <strong>Gabriel "FalleN" Toledo</strong>,<strong>Fernando "fer" Alvarenga</strong>,
            <strong>, Lincoln "fnx" Lau</strong>,<strong>Ricardo "boltz" Prass</strong> and <strong>Vinicius "VINI" Figueiredo</strong>.
            However, the team has changed over time. The organization also has a CrossFire team.

          </p>
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            On September 5, 2018, Imperial acquired the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team from Santos. In early 2022, after the contracts
            of all its players expired,the organization signed with "The Last Dance", a squad created by Gabriel "FalleN" Toledo that aimed to bring
            together veterans of the Brazilian competitive scene to seek great achievements again to Brazil.Rumors indicated that the initial idea was
            to reunite the five former members of the winning team of two Majors, one by Luminosity Gaming and the other by SK Gaming, composed by
            Gabriel "FalleN" Toledo, Fernando "fer" Alvarenga, Lincoln "fnx" Lau, Marcelo "coldzera" David and Epit√°cio "TACO" de Melo, however, these
            last two already had other projects and chose not to participate.Soon the Brazilians Ricardo "boltz" Prass and Vinicius "VINI" Figueiredo were 
            chosen to complete the team, in addition to Luis "peacemaker" Tadeu as coach.
